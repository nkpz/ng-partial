ng-partial
==========

tiny and simple alternative to ng-include that creates less dom nodes

this could have been a gist but I'm putting it here for easy bower installation. 

use in conjunction with 
https://github.com/remcohaszing/grunt-angular-templatecache
or
https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-angular-templatecache

and have less headaches over non-DRY markup, DOM pollution, and excessive http requests
